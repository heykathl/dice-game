# Project: TDD a single object

To achieve these goals:

> "I test-drive my code"  
> "I can work to a specification"  
> "I can write standards-compliant, clean object-oriented code"  
> "I can test-drive my code"  

# Action Plan

Apply what you have learned about TDD to building a single Dice object based on the following user stories.

> As a board game player,  
> So that I can play a game  
> I want to be able to roll a dice

> As a board game player,  
> So that I know how many steps I should move  
> Rolling a dice should give me a number between 1 and 6

> As a dice app developer,  
> So that I give players a good game experience  
> I want the dice roll to be randomly picked

> As a board game player,  
> So that I can play many types of games  
> I want to be able to roll any number of dice at the same time

> As a board game player,  
> So that I know what my score was when I rolled several dice  
> I want to get the result of each dice roll

Your focus here should be on adopting a rigorous TDD process - Red, Green, Refactor.
